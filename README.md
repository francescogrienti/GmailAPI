# GmailAPI
Small project whose final aim is to keep clean and reorder a Gmail address exploiting an API.
The project is still on-going due to some little fixes and the possibility to add some 
functionalities. 
The process was initially tought to be performed periodically making use of Crontab (Linux based systems).
